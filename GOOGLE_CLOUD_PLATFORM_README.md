## Set up Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform:

### Find your Region:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones

### Main Tutorial:
Follow the tutorial until you get to the part labeled:
"Deploying an application to the cluster"
Note: that the command to create the cluster typically takes around 15 minutes to complete.

When you get to the following command in the tutorial you can modify the number of "vm"s that will be dedicated to running your cluster. 

`gcloud container clusters create cluster-name --num-nodes=1`

Simply increase --num-nodes=1 to have the number of "vm"s you want.

## Run See Segment with Kubernetes
These commands must be executed in the kube_commands folder
`kubectl apply -f server_service.yaml`
`kubectl apply -f server.yaml`
`kubectl apply -f segmentation_job.yaml.yaml`

Everything should now be up and running.

## Access the Service

To access the service run:

`kubectl get services`

It takes a minute to get set up but eventually there will be an external ip for the server_service. By copying this ip into a browser you will be able to access the server. 


## Known Potential Issues:

### Fix:

If you have a very old version of gcloud it may be necessary to delete it. You can then restart the above steps.
